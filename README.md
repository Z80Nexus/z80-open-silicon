# Zilog Z80 modern open-source silicon clone
On the path to become a silicon proven, pin compatible, open-source replacement for classic Zilog Z80!

The first iteration is made for [Tiny Tapeout 07](https://tinytapeout.com) and is based on Guy Hutchison's [TV80](https://github.com/hutch31/tv80) Verilog core.
